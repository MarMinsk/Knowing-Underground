### Introduction
The brief for this project was to ceate a game that uses the concepts covered in the first two weeks of the course - specifically, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery.

###About the project
_Knowing Underground_ is a single player memory game quiz that tests the player's knowledge of the stations of the  London Underground. The game requires the player to correctly match as many London Underground tube stations as possible to their correct lines within a given time.

The game was built as my first project for the **General Assembly** _Web Development Immersive_ course, which required me to use the HTML, CSS,  JavaScript & JQuery concepts covered in the first two weeks of the course. We were given one week to build the game, which we then presented to the group on the final day of our project week.  

A hosted version of the game can be found [here] (https://dry-shore-72116.herokuapp.com/) and the code for the game can be found [here] (https://github.com/MarMinsk/Knowing-Underground).

###How to play the game

On clicking on the 'Start' button, the player is presented with a randomly generated London Underground tube station name. The player is also presented with buttons representing each of the London Underground tube lines. 

The player is required to click on the button(s) they think represent the correct lines for each station. The player then clicks on the 'Submit' button and the game will notify the player as to whether their selection is correct or not. If the player's selection is incorrect they must continue to select different lines until they either select the correct line or run out of time. 

###How the game was built
The game was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and used the JQuery library. Google Fonts and Animate.css were used for the stying of the game. 

The data source for the London Underground tube lines and stations was taken from [github source here].

### Credit
GA Instructors, Rane Gowan and Alex Chin, provided a huge amount of guidance with the JavaScript code and game logic.

GA Teaching Assistant, Natalie Huitson applied some amazing CSS skills to help with the styling of the game and create a bespoke logo for the game.
